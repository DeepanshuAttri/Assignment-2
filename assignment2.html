            <h2>Verse 1</h2>
            <p>Whoa, whoa, whoa
                <br>Whoa, whoa
                <br>If you're a lover, you should know
                <br>The lonely moments just get lonelier
                <br>The longer you're in love than if you were alone
                <br>Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo
                <br>I don't want to be afraid
                <br>The deeper that I go
                <br>It takes my breath away
                <br>Soft hearts, electric souls
                <br>Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
                <br>Is this taboo?
                <br>Baby, we built this house on memories
                <br>Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
                <br>And when your fantasies become your legacy
                <br>Promise me a place in your house of memories</p>

            <p>Whoa, whoa, whoa
               <br> Whoa, whoa
               <br>I think of you from time to time
               <br> More than I thought I would
               <br>You were just too kind and I was too young to know
               <br>That's all that really matters
               <br> I was a fool
               <br>Baby, we built this house on memories
               <br>Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
               <br>And when your fantasies become your legacy
               <br>Promise me a place in your house of memories

                Those thoughts of past lovers, they'll always haunt me
                <br> I wish I could believe you'd never wrong me
                <br>Then will you remember me in the same way as I remember you?
                <br>Baby, we built this house on memories
                <br>Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
                <br>And when your fantasies become your legacy
                <br>Promise me a place
                <br>Baby, we built this house on memories
                <br>Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
                <br>And when your fantasies become your legacy
                <br>Promise me a place in your house of memories
                <br>Whoa, whoa, whoa
                <br>Whoa, whoa
                <br>In your house of memories
                <br>Whoa, whoa
                <br>Promise me a place (whoa, whoa)
